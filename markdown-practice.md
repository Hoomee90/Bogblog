# Bogblog - For all witches and bitches
## Voidborn Teeth and Petal of Deathcrown
Hi everybody! It'll be a shorter post today, as my sister is still recovering from deathcap withdrawl. For posterity's sake, I feel obligated to once again tell you **do not *ever* handle mind altering ingredients alone.** This goes double for pychomemetics, and *triple* for addictive ones. I love my sister with all my heart,  but she is a dumbass.
