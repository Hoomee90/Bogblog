## Voidborn Teeth and Petal of Deathcrown
Hi everybody! It'll be a shorter post today, as my sister is still recovering from deathcap withdrawl. For posterity's sake, I feel obligated to once again tell you **do not *ever* handle mind altering ingredients alone.** This goes double for pychomemetics, and *triple* for addictive ones. I love my sister with all my heart,  but she is a dumbass.

With that out of the way, today we'll be talking about Voidborn teeth and Petal of Deathcrown! Now, these are both *tertiary* ingredients, meaning they don't modify  what the potion *does* or *how* it does it, rather it modifies the potions properties, from cosmetic changes to boosting effectiveness or shelf-life. 

If you want a more detailed overiew of the different tiers of potion ingredients I recommend [my post from two years ago](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9140035/chapters/20766790). Don't be sacred off by the change in tone, I was going through a massive kawii phase. The information still holds up, though
